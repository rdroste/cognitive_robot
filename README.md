# Cognitive Robot

Cognitive robot to diagnose disorders of motor skills and coordination in children

## Introduction
Many children suffer from Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), a motor skill disorder that affects 5 to 6% of all school aged children<sup>1</sup>. The affected children have difficulties performing everyday tasks and therefore suffer from significant impairment of their quality of life. However, DCD is difficult to diagnose since, by definition, it is not linked to any identifiable medical of neurological disorders. Therefore, designing accurate methods for diagnosing the disorders are crucial.

The JRED team set out to combine a high-tech robot with state-of-the-art computer cognition to potentially revolutionize the diagnosis of DCD. While traditional methods are conducted by pen and paper, we offer more quantitative metrics, a standardized test allowing for consistent results, and an innovative human-robot-computer interface to allow for a stress-free experience for the child.

Our tests are inspired by standart test, such as the ABC test<sup>2</sup> and the Purdue Pegboard Test<sup>3</sup>
